# Python Challenge 1: Food Truck Ordering System

## Overview
This project is part of the Module 2 Challenge for Columbia University's AI Bootcamp. It implements an interactive ordering system for a food truck using Python. The program allows users to select items from a menu, specify quantities, and generate a receipt with the total price.

## Features
- Display a food truck menu to the user.
- Enable menu item selection and quantity specification.
- Perform input validation for menu selections and quantities.
- Generate and display an order summary and total price.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KenStager/python-challenge-1.git
```

## Usage
To run the program, navigate to the cloned directory and execute:
```bash
python menu.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to place your order.

## How It Works
- The program starts by displaying a menu to the user.
- Users select items by entering corresponding menu numbers.
- Input validation is implemented to ensure valid selections.
- After each selection, users are prompted to enter the quantity.
- The program supports continuous ordering until the user decides to finish.
- Finally, a receipt is generated, displaying each item, quantity, and the total cost.
